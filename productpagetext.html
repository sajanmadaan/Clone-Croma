    <span class="grey">So, what makes Mobile phones so important?</span class="grey">
    <p class="protext">Phones have revolutionised the way we do things. One can hardly imagine living without them in the present age. The beloved phone that you have now, and the ones that are yet to come, offer a ton of benefits, among which includes connecting you to the world, keeping you updated with all the latest happenings. Smartphones are, as the name suggest, smart devices that are here to make your life simpler and easier. Smartphones show you time, date, calculate numbers, wake you up when you want them to, remind you of something important, and find location through the GPS navigation. They come with cameras so that you can click pictures and make videos that you can cherish later. To keep your boredom away, your phones can play audio and video, and be your e-book reader or your gaming device. The recorder in a phone provides another advantage of recording your own voice and also that of others.</p>
    <span class="grey">All that is fine, but what about technology?</span class="grey">
    <p class="protext">From pressing on keys, we have moved to pressing the screen directly; we have seen the shift from MBs to GBs, from zero camera to five cameras, from a few megapixels to more than hundred megapixels, from simple calls and games to video calls and high-end gaming phones, from flip to foldable, the growth story of mobile phones has been phenomenal, and, of course, one can never know what marvels the future holds. Mobile technology has advanced drastically and it keeps on evolving. The future will bring enormous development in the telephony segment, and connection will become seamless like never before. Let’s understand a bit of the technology behind Mobile phones.</p>
    <p class="protext">Mobile phones are classified as Smartphones and Feature phones. <span ><a href="#">smartphones</a></span> have an operating system such as iOS, Android, and they usually have a touchscreen interface. They can connect you to the internet and provide the option to download apps. They are equipped with camera through which photos can be clicked and videos can be recorded, and they also offer storage space so that information can be saved. Smartphones have connectivity options like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and they also give an added advantage in the form of personal assistance like Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, for our convenience. Smartphones can be secured with security features like pin, pattern, fingerprint and face lock. The latest smartphones come with foldable screens! A feature phone on the other hand is a simple phone that comes with button keys which people use mostly to make calls and, to some extent, to send messages.</p>
    <p class="protext">For the purpose of connection, phones use CDMA, GSM, LTE technologies. CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access; phones with this network come with built-in chip, which means there is no way of switching to any network other than the one which comes with the phone. GSM stands for Global System for Mobile communication; this is the network which is most popular throughout the world. The phones that supports GSM come with separate slot for inserting SIM card, and you can choose whichever network service provider you like. LTE (Long Term Evolution) is the 4G standard accepted globally, and most new phones utilize 4G for the transmission of data. The term VoLTE, that one often hears a phone supports, refers to Voice over Long Term Evolution which is a way of making calls by using data packet (data which is transmitted through the internet) instead of depending on traditional voice calls. VoLTE has made roaming call charges a thing of the past.</p>
    <p class="protext">Mobile communication standards are named as 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G. The G stands for generation, which is a way of identifying as well as marketing the service packages that are on offer. The era of 1G and 2G are gone. We are presently in the world of 3G and 4G. While 3G has data bandwidth of 2 Mbps – 21 Mbps, 4G has bandwidth of 2 Mbps – 1 Gbps. Each new generation gets better and brings in a faster and smoother way of communication. And as with any electronic devices, the new makes the old obsolete after a certain time. New phones have faster speed, better coverage and reliability. 5G is one such advancement in the mobile phone sphere. It is yet in its nascent stage, but it promises to change the way we communicate. If 4G network seems to do wonders for us, 5G would do ten times more wonders. Smartphones with 5G network would allow high speed and seamless internet connectivity which would particularly help in every real time applications, such as operating self-driving cars which requires a continuous stream of fast internet for receiving signals. Even though 4G provides us a good connection over the internet but it still stops working when you are at a certain place (such as when you are in a running train), with 5G such disturbances are supposed to be completely curtailed. Voice and video calls would be much better than it is at present.</p>
    <p class="protext">While there are a few operating systems, but let us save some time and only emphasize on two which are the most popular, namely Android and iOS. The operating system which is designed only for iPhone and other Apple devices such as iPad, iPod is called iOS. Android is an open-source platform (which allows third parties to use the interface) designed by the search engine giant Google.<span ><a href="#">iPhones</a></span> have better security features as compared to <span class="teallink"><a href="#">Android phones</a></span>, BlackBerry phones, which are not many in the market (but available at Croma), used to have its own operating system but it now relies on Android.</p>
    <p class="protext">Other factors to consider while looking up for a phone are: Memory (the RAM and the internal memory; more the capacity, more the storage capacity; also, most phones come with expandable memory feature); chipset (such as Snapdragon by Qualcomm, Exynos by Samsung, Kirin by Huawei; the latest version of these chipsets provides a faster and smoother user experience); the camera (for instant click of those special moments); battery life which determines how many hours the battery of a phone will last; battery charging technology (such as Dash Charge and Warp Charge by OnePlus, Adaptive Fast Charging by Samsung; Oppo has shown the capability of charging its phone Reno Ace with VOOC technology from zero to 100 percent under 30 minutes). Mobile Phones are now aware of their environment; they have various kinds of sensors (like fingerprint, proximity, compass, etc.) which understands our commands, movements, gestures, and environmental conditions, and accordingly helps us achieve the desired outcome. The photographer in you would surely want a great camera in a phone that captures all the details and comes with good zooming ability, not just the rear camera but the selfie lover should also have a reason to feel good, thus a phone with great rear and front camera will do the trick. The display of new mobile phones are of extremely high quality, this makes watching videos and movies a joy. Smartphones nowadays support 2K and 4K displays, which are giving HD TVs a run for their money.</p>
    <p class="protext"><span ><a href="#">Mobile accessories</a></span> such as cases and covers, mobile chargers, USB cables and connectors, mobile anti-virus, and selfie sticks not only protect your mobile phones but also come handy in case of an emergency.</p>
    <span class="grey">So, which is the best mobile phone for you?</span class="grey">
    <p class="protext">Well, this is completely subjective to a person’s taste, usage and preference. What may be best suited for one, may not actually be a wise choice for the other. Some may value price while some others may focus on features. Mobile phone manufacturers keep adding new and innovative features in mobile phones every year to enable a phone user to easily use apps to get their work done instead of a computer. The latest Smartphones come with a quad or octa core processor to give the user a seamless multitasking experience. The latest mobile phones offer powerful processors and amazing gaming experiences. These Smartphones have powerful GPUs for high-end gaming performance. Also, the latest smartphones have extremely good camera quality. Among the premium phones, Apple and Samsung have been running at the forefront for a while, but their phones are pretty expensive. OnePlus has gained smartphone users’ trust within a short span of time by offering beautifully designed phones with cutting-edge technology, and is surely giving a tough competition to both Apple and Samsung. Xiaomi, with its latest phones, is proving to be a flagship killer.</p>
